# Reminder of the Day
A reminder of quotes worth sharing.

## Why?

At school, just after classes began, we had a 5 minute reminder with a thoughtful quote of the day. This does the same by sharing a list of crowdsourced quotes, once a day to Twitter. Everyone has a list of quotes they love and hence if you don't already find your favorite(s), send in a PR to add yours.

## How to add your quote

Send a PR to [this CSV file](reminders.csv) with your quote and your handles.
