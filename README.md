# Reminder of the Day [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cggaurav/reminderoftheday.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cggaurav/reminderoftheday)

A reminder of quotes worth sharing.

## Why?

At school, just after classes began, we had a 5 minute reminder with a thoughtful quote of the day. This does the same by sharing a list of crowdsourced quotes, once a day to Twitter. Everyone has a list of quotes they love and hence if you don't already find your favorite(s), send in a PR to add yours.

## How can I add my favorite quotes?
